            Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions
            characterized by excessive fear or worry that is difficult to
            control. Common types of anxiety disorders include generalized
            anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and
            specific phobias. Symptoms may include restlessness, rapid
            heartbeat, sweating, trembling, difficulty concentrating, and
            avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations. These disorders can
            interfere with daily activities and quality of life.
