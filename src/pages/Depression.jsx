            Depression, also known as major depressive disorder (MDD), is a mood
            disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of
            interest or pleasure in activities, and a range of physical and
            emotional symptoms. These symptoms may include changes in appetite
            or weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue, difficulty concentrating,
            feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and thoughts of death or
            suicide. Depression can significantly impair daily functioning and
            quality of life.
