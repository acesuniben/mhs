                Depression, also known as major depressive disorder (MDD), is a
                mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness,
                loss of interest or pleasure in activities, and a range of
                physical and emotional symptoms. These symptoms may include
                changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue,
                difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or guilt,
                and thoughts of death or suicide. Depression can significantly
                impair daily functioning and quality of life.
