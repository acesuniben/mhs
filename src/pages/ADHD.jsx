                ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by patterns of
                inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with
                functioning or development. Symptoms may include difficulty
                focusing, forgetfulness, excessive talking, fidgeting, and
                difficulty organizing tasks. ADHD can affect children and persist
                into adulthood, impacting academic, occupational, and social
                functioning.
